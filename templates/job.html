    <h1>Skills and Jobs</h1><br>
    <h3>Product manager</h3><br>
    <p>A product manager is the main point of contact for clients and authorised representatives , in the case of the travel app , venture capitalists. A product manager will identify the needs of users and business goals , turning these requirements into tasks for a team. A product manager will typically work on three processes regarding the introduction of a product in corporations which are :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Product Planning which involves the analysis of product ideas and features</li>
  <li>Product Introduction which involves cross-functional team management, product launch management</li>
  <li>Product Life Cycle Management which could involve service collection of user data , future development planning and strategy planning</li>
</ul>
<p>All these processes a product manager carries out requires the skills of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Empathy for end users</li>
  <li>Strong decision making skills</li>
  <li>Strong analytical skills</li>
  <li>Problem solving skills</li>
  <li>Digital marketing skills</li>
  <li>Excellence in communication, presentation and interpersonal skills</li>
</ul><br>
    <h3>Software Developer</h3><br>
    <p>A Software developer required for the travel app is required to be proficient in front and back end development. Technical skills required are high proficiency front end languages ,JavaScript frameworks, server side languages ,database technologies microservices development , Android SDKs and IOS SDKs. The outcomes of a developer will include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Working with a UX designer to meet user goals</li>
      <li>Developing APIs for mobile functionality</li>
      <li>App development</li>
      <li>Assessing guidelines of app store operators</li>
      <li>Overseeing the software development process from ideation to deployment</li>
      <li>Managing the complete software development process from conception to deployment</li>
      <li>Maintenance of software following deployment</li>
    </ul><br>
    <h3>UX designer</h3><br>
    <p>A UX Designer is concerned in User Experience design to accommodate user satisfaction in a holistic manner to include aspects of usability , accessibility , function and design. The activities of a UX designer can be separated into two categories of which is user experience design (UXD) and second is user experience research (UXR).</p>
    <p>UXR is the process involving primary research, secondary, research and third-party research while UXD is the process of designing a solution to a product. These two activities together work on where the goals of the business and users converge , in trying to meet the demands of both parties. A UX Designer for the Travel App is required to bridge evidence-based design and user experience design with usage of software such as FlowMapp ,Sketch, Figma ,Adobe XD and Adobe Creative Suite and tools such as personas , interactive prototypes , use case scenarios and customer research.</p>
    <p>The processes that a UX Designer for the travel app will loosely resemble:</p>
    <ol>
      <br><h5><li>User profiles and personas</li></h5>
      <p>This initial step for a UX designer consists of the creation of user profiles and personas. This step is particularly useful in being able to replicate the experiences and emotions of a customer. Making of profiles and personas is typically achieved through analytics and associated data in addition to internal and external interviews and surveys.</p>
      <br><h5><li>Interface testing</li></h5>
      <p>Multiple interfaces are compared in effectiveness and quality of experience , including the current site used.</p>
      <br><h5><li>User surveys & interviews</li></h5>
      <p>This process , a human-centered design process, involves interviewing potential users of the web app in order to gain an experience-centered perspective in order to evaluate design. Two methods are used to gain the experience-centered perspective of users in the form of surveys and interviews such as structured interviews, semi-structured interviews, and unstructured interviews.</p>
      <br><h5><li>User flow diagram</li></h5>
      <p>A flowchart is created in order to visualize how a user would move through the app and the steps taken to achieve their goal. Stakeholders are able to view the most efficient form of the flow of the app through a breakdown of what the user does and sees when using the app such as signing up and logging in.</p>
      <br><h5><li>Wireframes and prototypes</li></h5>
      <p>Wireframes and prototypes are used to approximate the location of elements of dialogs and buttons , providing how web pages or an app looks and feels. With wireframes and prototyping , issues regarding usability can be eliminated before adjustments further down the line are required. Low fidelity prototypes such as clickthrough prototypes can be useful in gaining insight of the basic interactive experience of the end product. High fidelity digital prototypes such as those on Proto are can be useful in getting final design approval from stakeholders in being interactive for usability testing and giving an idea of the feel and function of the end product.</p>
      <br><h5><li>Style tiles & Style guides</li></h5>
      <p>Design patterns set consistency in choosing the most effective design for a task based on usability. Style tiles and style guides help maintain consistency in providing guidelines for typography ,color scheme, button shapes, sizes & colors and brand attributes.</p>

    </ol><br>
    <h3>Software Testers</h3><br>
    <p>Having testers involved in requirements reviews or user story refinement could detect defects in these work products before any design or coding is done for the functionality described. Identifying and removing defects at this stage reduces the risk of the wrong software (incorrect or untestable) being developed. Besides that, professional tester are more trained to verify and validate the software prior to release can detect failures that might otherwise have been missed – this is traditionally where the focus of testing has been. If we leave it until release, we will not be nearly as efficient as we would have been if we had caught these defects earlier. However, it is still necessary to test just before release, and they can also help to support debugging activities, for example, by running confirmation and regression tests.Other than that, having testers work closely with system designers while the system is being designed can increase each party’s understanding of the design and how to test it. Since misunderstandings are often the cause for defects in software, having a better understanding at this stage can reduce the risk of design defects. A bonus is that tests can be identified from the design – thinking about how to test the system at this stage often results in better design. Lastly, having testers work closely with developers while the code is under development can increase each party’s understanding of the code and how to test it. As with design, this increased understanding, and the knowledge of how the code will be tested, can reduce the risk of defects in the code (and in the tests). </p>
