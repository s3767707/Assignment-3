    <h4>Software Testers</h4><br>
    <p>Having testers involved in requirements reviews or user story refinement could detect defects in these work products before any design or coding is done for the functionality described. Identifying and removing defects at this stage reduces the risk of the wrong software (incorrect or untestable) being developed. Besides that, professional tester are more trained to verify and validate the software prior to release can detect failures that might otherwise have been missed – this is traditionally where the focus of testing has been. If we leave it until release, we will not be nearly as efficient as we would have been if we had caught these defects earlier. However, it is still necessary to test just before release, and they can also help to support debugging activities, for example, by running confirmation and regression tests.Other than that, having testers work closely with system designers while the system is being designed can increase each party’s understanding of the design and how to test it. Since misunderstandings are often the cause for defects in software, having a better understanding at this stage can reduce the risk of design defects. A bonus is that tests can be identified from the design – thinking about how to test the system at this stage often results in better design. Lastly, having testers work closely with developers while the code is under development can increase each party’s understanding of the code and how to test it. As with design, this increased understanding, and the knowledge of how the code will be tested, can reduce the risk of defects in the code (and in the tests).</p>
