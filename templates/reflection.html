<p>I am a newbie, and IT is quite an exciting field, but it is also challenging. After assessment two and coming to assessment 3, I am pleased to have great teammates. They help me a lot in terms of knowledge, as well as where I can help them. Anson is one of the people who helped the team and me a lot. He helped me while I was working on the front-end. I did not know what to do or what to write. I asked him, and he guided me. The rest of the team also completed the parts they were assigned. In addition, our team has two meetings a week to discuss difficulties and solve them together. I am delighted and satisfied to be collaborating with such teammates.

<p>I am pretty much satisfied with all our performance in this group project. We did not have a great start as we all felt lost due to lack of knowledge and experience in the software development process. The relieved part is we managed to pull ourselves together by doing a tonne of research and actually planned our process. I am very convinced that there is a huge improvement in terms of efficiency and teamwork after working through assignment two together. I am satisfied with my own contribution in this project as everything is working out as planned. For this project, I planned all my progress before the assignment due date and made sure I stick to it. As a result, all my tasks are completed on time and cause no delay to other’s work. In my opinion, Jake and Mitchell did a great job on working on the prototype and the current progress looks convincing to me. They both play a great role as the meeting coordinator at my own point as they kind of lead all of our meetings. It is just pleasing to have teammates that have great communication skills which are able to connect all of us together and come up as a team. Besides that, Dat and Vincent have contributed more on the report content part and play the role of a team member pretty well. They are willing to contribute ideas and work in order to sort out this assignment. Other than that, they are ready to learn and absorb new skills and knowledge and apply them right on the spot. Everyone is responsible enough to attend all meetings and complete their tasks. This project would not have success without all of us. Overall, I am glad to have such teammates and looking forward to our future collaborations.
