    <h1>Group Reflection</h1><br><br>
    <p>Reflecting upon past experience is an important capability for all professionals in order to develop better communications skills, conflict resolution and enhance future performance. To look back on the simulation that was conducted as group work this semester has allowed participating students to gain many practical skills in our industry.  It could be argued that our team performed well overall; yet more effective delegation and organisation skills could have been improved.
</p>
    <p>Our team comprised five members and were all delegated with a particular role within the simulation.This has demonstrated that a team is more than the sum of its component parts. Crucial to what we did was assessing and recognising our strengths and contacts and bringing them together to create something more powerful that any of us individually. It also became clear that when you do this a real dynamic and momentum is built up and we realised that the team itself develops an identity that is much more than the additive talents of the people within it.</p>
    <p>To therefore reflect upon some of the challenges that the simulation brought to our team, and how we could resolve them, it could be said that effective delegation and time management seemed to hamper us. At the time, our team noticed that it was often hard to delegate tasks to team members. This was often due to conflicting schedules, workloads and other commitments. Having experienced these issues and to critically reflect upon them, it could be argued that our team should have been more realistic about the timing of activities, clearly determining who was responsible and effectively ensuring that we could achieve the simulation goals in adequate time.</p>
    <p>In commenting upon the team dynamics, as well as the academic literature that has supported the learning this semester, it can be argued that a new set of knowledge and understanding has been created. In addition, it has been particularly important to become a reflective practitioner and that in undertaking such observations helps to improve not only one's performance but also enhance discipline-specific knowledge.</p>

<p>I am a newbie, and IT is quite an exciting field, but it is also challenging. After assessment two and coming to assessment 3, I am pleased to have great teammates. They help me a lot in terms of knowledge, as well as where I can help them. Anson is one of the people who helped the team and me a lot. He helped me while I was working on the front-end. I did not know what to do or what to write. I asked him, and he guided me. The rest of the team also completed the parts they were assigned. In addition, our team has two meetings a week to discuss difficulties and solve them together. I am delighted and satisfied to be collaborating with such teammates.

<h3>Anson Go</h3>

<p>I am pretty much satisfied with all our performance in this group project. We did not have a great start as we all felt lost due to lack of knowledge and experience in the software development process. The relieved part is we managed to pull ourselves together by doing a tonne of research and actually planned our process. I am very convinced that there is a huge improvement in terms of efficiency and teamwork after working through assignment two together. I am satisfied with my own contribution in this project as everything is working out as planned. For this project, I planned all my progress before the assignment due date and made sure I stick to it. As a result, all my tasks are completed on time and cause no delay to other’s work. In my opinion, Jake and Mitchell did a great job on working on the prototype and the current progress looks convincing to me. They both play a great role as the meeting coordinator at my own point as they kind of lead all of our meetings. It is just pleasing to have teammates that have great communication skills which are able to connect all of us together and come up as a team. Besides that, Dat and Vincent have contributed more on the report content part and play the role of a team member pretty well. They are willing to contribute ideas and work in order to sort out this assignment. Other than that, they are ready to learn and absorb new skills and knowledge and apply them right on the spot. Everyone is responsible enough to attend all meetings and complete their tasks. This project would not have success without all of us. Overall, I am glad to have such teammates and looking forward to our future collaborations.

<p>This third piece of assessment has been a big one. At times it has felt never ending. The beginning few weeks were good, we had a good momentum going and Anson really helped guide the team and provide some really good resources for us to use in our sections. Overall, both assignments with this group have taught me many things and I have quite enjoyed my time with the boys. Even in the final week and it is quite evident that people, including myself, are a bit burnt out and stressed with all our assignments being due, the team is still pushing to deliver a good finished product. The content, the programs and tools used throughout both assignments have been quite fun to learn and use.

<h3>Mitchell Taylor</h3>
  </div>
<p>At the beginning of this project, our group felt quite overwhelmed at the idea of having to plan out how we would implement our travel idea into a working prototype due to our lack of app development knowledge and experience. Anson really helped pull our group together by delegating roles to each of us as well as suggesting websites that we can use such as proto.io. Toward the end of the project, the team was feeling burnt out and meeting quality declined as some meetings were missed (myself included), but I believe that the quality of work did not. I’ve learnt that everyone always has something of value that they can contribute to the group. </p>

<h3>Vincent Lu</h3>
  </div>
<p>This third assessment isa sign of relief being a sign of a close completion for the Intro to IT course. Noticeably we are more burnt out in this project but we have Anson in this group who go the project up and going. This project is more technical than previous assignments and is of higher difficulty but overall , communication between group members is good and the trajectory of this project appears to be heading in a good direction. </p>
